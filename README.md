# flavio – flavour phenomenology in the Standard model and beyond

flavio is a Python package to compute observables in flavour physics, electroweak precision tests, Higgs physics,
and other precision tests of the Standard Model, both in
the Standard Model and in the presence of new physics encoded in Wilson
coefficients of dimension-6 operators.
